- Create a new virtual environment with python <=3.9 and activate it.
- Install rich and all its requirements in the environment with `pip install -r ../requirements.txt` (If you have cloned the repo).
- I'll make this a click-based package soon, but for now add the following line in your `~/.bashrc` file - 

    `alias freepy=python <path_to_freepy>/freepy.py`
- Execute `source ~/.bashrc`
- Re-activate this python environment created in step 1.
- Execute `freepy`
